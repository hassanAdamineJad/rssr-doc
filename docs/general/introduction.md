### `Note:` Component style file must be named as camel case in RSSR

- `provider/webpack`: This folder contains webpack configuration 

- `provider/setup`: 


### `public/`
Here is where all the static files are stored.



### `src/`
This is the body of our application.

# RSSR Directory
There are two kind of directory in RSSR.
- [Entity Directory](#entity-directory)
- [Wrap Directory](#wrap-directory)

## Entity Directory
An entity directory is any singular, identifiable and separate directory and grow subcomponent like tree structure. ex: home.js, about.js etc.

## Wrap Directory
It doesn't have Entity directory and isolated with their behvior, in fact to make project readable, they can hold different entity inside.

### `Note:` Wrap directory can be chaining like partial, component folder can be connected togather inside like graph structure

## Special Directory
- [ `__style` Directory](#style-directory)
- [ `__action` Directory](#action-directory)
- [ `__component` Directory](#component-directory)


### `Note:` Two underline give an alert, there is a special case

##  __style Directory: 
`__style` directory used when two component has common style. it solve this rare issues by creating `__style` in the first parent of that directory to handle duplicate style.

## `__action` Directory:
`__action` directory used when two component has common action. create `__action` in the first parent of that directory to handle duplicate action.

## `__Component` Directory:
`__Component` is used when a component is same in multiple container, we can solve the issue by creating `__Component` in the first parent of that directory to handle duplicate component.

## Basic Building Blocks
